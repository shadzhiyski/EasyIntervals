# Intervals.Tools

This .NET package provides basic set of tools for working with generic intervals in the form series of (start, end, interval type) pairs. Supported operations are intersect, except, merge, invert, union etc. from the class **`IntervalSet`**.

`// TODO: Enhance with invert; slice; union(itv[]); complement(itv, itv); inRange(itv/limit)`

If you have use case, handling collection of intervals.

## About

There aren't many packages available on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/), providing these functionalities with flexible and friendly enough programming API. My goal is to provide useful and rich library for convenient work with intervals. Hence, I created this enhanced one.

However, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.
